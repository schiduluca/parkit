# Alone on Mars
An astronaut becomes stranded on Mars after his team assume him dead, and must rely on his ingenuity to find a way to survive as much time as he can until his team will come to rescue.


### Game play
You have to build as much protection as you can during the day, because during the night time the enemies will come to attack you.
If enemies destroy your database, you will lose the game.

To make the droids work for you, you have to "feed" them with power capsules.

The capsules have to be extracted from ground, by player or farmer droids.

You can also build walls, and upgrade them for more protection.
